# Poke-Memo

Poke-Memo is a fun and challenging memory game built with React that utilizes the Pokémon API to fetch dynamic images and information. In this game, players select cards without repeating their previous choices. With three difficulty levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard—the game keeps track of your current score and your best score achieved so far. Card tilt effects are added using Parallax Tilt for an extra visual flair.

- **Pokémon API Integration:** Fetches Pokémon images and details from an external API to populate the game cards.
- **Card Tilt Effects:** Uses Parallax Tilt to add interactive, animated tilt effects to the cards.
